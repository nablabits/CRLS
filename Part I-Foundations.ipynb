    ">For a concrete example, let us pit a faster computer (computer A) running insertion sort against a slower computer (computer B) running merge sort. They each must sort an array of 10 million numbers. (Although 10 million numbers might seem like a lot, if the numbers are eight-byte integers, then the input occupies about 80 megabytes, which fits in the memory of even an inexpensive laptop com-puter many times over.) Suppose that computer A executes 10 billion instructions per second (faster than any single sequential computer at the time of this writing)\n",
    "and computer B executes only 10 million instructions per second, so that computer A is 1000 times faster than computer B in raw computing power. To make the difference even more dramatic, suppose that the worldâ€™s craftiest programmer codes insertion sort in machine language for computer A, and the resulting code requires $2n^2$ instructions to sort n numbers. Suppose further that just an average programmer implements merge sort, using a high-level language with an inefficient compiler, with the resulting code taking $50n\\log_2(n)$ instructions."

    "> A loop invariant is a statement about program variables that is true before and after each iteration of a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the three properties seen before:\n",
    "* **Initialization:** the condition holds before the first iteration\n",
    "* **Maintenance:** the condition holds over loops. If the invariant is true before an iteration of the loop, it should be true also after the iteration.\n",
    "* **Termination:** When the loop is terminated the invariant should tell us something useful, something that helps us understand the algorithm.\n",
